				<p>Hi! Welcome to my page!</p>
				<p>In 2016, I made the decision to attend NYU Shanghai. This decision has not only brought about a lot of personal growth, but also many questions about my experience too!
				So in hopes of answering some FAQ's, feel free to navigate this website by clicking on the navigation bar above!</p>

			<p id="schooltext">One of the things I love about NYUSH is the sense of community we have. We're an extremely new, small, and experimental school. Whether you're a Chinese or international student, coming here will bring you out of your comfort zone. These factors make us develop a sense of understanding among each other. Campus wise, we're in the financial area of Shanghai, so we're surrounded by people clad in suits. It's not very "exciting" in that sense, but it's very peaceful and inspirational to sit outside and be surrounded by major banks and such. Overall, because we're such a diverse bunch, you're constantly in an environment to learn from others and their culture, both inside and outside the classroom.</p>

				<p class="text" id="watertext">All international students are required to take up to intermediate 2 Chinese. Because of this requirement, the international student community has our own "Chinglish" language that is hard to turn off when we go back home. I love this little habit because when I talk to college friends from Shanghai, we can share inside jokes and just have a mutual understanding of the struggles/awesomeness of learning Chinese.</p>

				<p class="text" id="olympicstext">One of the benefits of being in Shanghai is the travel opportunities! Obviously there are many amazing places to travel to in China, but Shanghai is also so much closer to the other fun travel destinations. Spring break? Two hour plane to Japan. Long weekend? Let's go to the Phillipines! A major highlight of being in Shanghai for me has been being able to go see the Winter Olympics in Korea, along with many other trips abroad. </p>

			<div id="text3"></div>
				<p class="text" id="culturetext">Being in China has been a very humbling experience. I've been forced to think about politics on a much deeper level when I'm outside of my home country, surrounded by people who are culturally not of my own. The constant exposure to Chinese culture has changed my outlook on China too. In America, the news has a tendency to portray China as a strict outsider. But living in China has made me, and many other students, understand why the culture is the way that it is, and appreciate it too.</p>

				<p class="text" id="peopletext">College has always been known as a place to make life-long friends. But it has truly been a blessing to meet so many people from different countries. My friend group has truly become more international after being in NYUSH, and I aways feel grateful to be constantly exposed to so many new cultures, perspectives, and just plain good people.</p>

			<p id="considertext">There are a few challenges that come with living in Shanghai. There are the obvious ones such as pollution, adjusting to a new culture and language, etc. But to be more specific, nightlife is not nearly as great in Shanghai as it is in New York. You're lucky to find a restaurant that still takes tables at 9:30pm (gasp!). Places to explore are also very spread out, so it can be time consuming to travel around such a big city. Also, the number of people there is insane. I remember very distinctly on my first night of being in Shanghai, going to the Bund and seeing the police guiding masses of people. I thought there was a parade or something, but my Chinese roommate told me that it was just a normal Friday night. </p>
